# HTML Table Styling Codes

I often use this code to style my HTML tables created in Power Automate. Itâ€™s a simple and effective way to control how the table looks, ensuring the columns are sized correctly and that the table has a neat and professional appearance (credit to Reza Dorrani and Ryan Maclean).

This CSS code applies various styles to a table, including setting borders, text alignment, background colours, and spacing. It also has specific rules for the first column and adjusts the appearance of the header row to make it stand out with a bold, white font on a dark blue background.
